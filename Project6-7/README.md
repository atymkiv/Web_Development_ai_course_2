I am a software developer with strong knowledge in Golang. Now I’m developing backend for web project. In this project I use the following stack of technologies: Microservice architecture, Golang Echo framework (for backend server), rpc(communication between microservices), kubernetes, docker (deployement project on Google Cloud – GKE – Google Kubernetes Engine), kubeflow (running ML workflows in Kubernetes), postgresql, redis, cassandra (Databases). I am implementing innovative software solutions, endpoints like uploading ML pipelines and running them on clients kubernetes cluster, automating analyze of ml workflow’s output and so on. I also fix different bugs that occur during  development, write Unit and integrational tests and write documentation for our microservices
